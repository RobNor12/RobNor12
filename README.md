**Introduction**

Hello, welcome to this branch of my git repository, This repository branch contains my completed problem sets and final projects from Harvard University's CS50x course. This coursework provided the fundamental programming logic and algorithms that underpin my data analysis and SQL querying skills.

****Skills learned****

Programming Fundamentals (C): Mastery of variable declaration, loops, conditional logic, and memory management.

Algorithmic Thinking: Implementation of sorting, searching (Binary Search), and recursive algorithms.

Python Proficiency: Applying higher-level programming concepts for efficient data manipulation and abstraction.

Data Structures: Practical use of arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and dictionaries.

SQL & Database Concepts: Foundational understanding of relational database design, querying, and manipulation.
