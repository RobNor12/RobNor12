Description: a website that allows users to monitor, bookmark and look up stocks, I used python and flask for the logic I used very little to no javascript as I am not to comfortable with that language in comparision to python, I also used html and css to make the website look clean, to get the database I used sqlite, to get the stocks I needed I used alpha vantage stock api using the free tier, this project was tricky as I had to find a way to make the website work while also working around the alpha vantage free tier limitations, this project was very fun for me as it allowed me to expirment and test out my skills in python and I did consult with chatgpt to help me figure out what I did wrong and what I needed to do to get started with my website, I set a hard no to allowing users to trade, buy and sell stocks as that would expand much beyond the scope of this project and would reuquire much stiffer code and legal parimaters that I am unable to configure, I would say the biggest frustation of this project wasn't the code but rather trying to work around alpha vantage's free limits as many times the website would break and I wouldn't know why unless I altered the code, overall this project was a great capstone for my harvard cs50 course as it allowed me to use my learned skills and explore more parts of python
