####Description: My project is titled Wall Watcher, Wall Watcher is a simple website that allows users to monitor, and bookmark stocks, for this project to work I did have to levarage an API, the API I choose was the Alpha Vantage free tier api, I choose this project to enable me to get hands on experience with data analysis to help me pursue that career field, I did consult with and use chatgpt to help me with the code and the problems I ran into while creating this project, now I choose to limit this website to just a stock monitor as if I expanded it to allow for users to buy and trade stocks it would add to the complexity and I would need far more rigid code along with getting me into legal parameters I am not equipped to or comfortable handling at this stage of my coding journey

To create this website, I primarily used Python and the Flask library. I could have used some JavaScript, and it may have made it easier to design and taken less time to make, but I am far more comfortable using Python and the Flask library than JavaScript, which is why I made the logic in Python instead of JavaScript. I used CSS and HTML to make the website look clean and simple, and to ensure the user would have a good UX experience, to create the databases and tables for this project I used SQLite

the way the website works is that by using the Alpha vantage free tier users can look up stocks that they want to monitor, then by using flask the user can connect with that alpha vantage api to add and bookmark that specific stock, originally I was planning on their being a huge amount of stocks on the homepage but after finding out the free tier limit on alpha vantage I instead made an auto stock dictionary, which is a dictionary that always loads one stock in this case Apple company to allow users to see how the website works as if there was no stocks the user would be guessing the whole time which would not be a good UX design, one tricky thing I found is that I tried to load multiple autostocks at once but I found that loading multiple at the same time would cause a problem in that users could not see the prices of the autostocks, which is why I ultimately went with just one autostock to ensure the users can properly see how the website functions. One thing I didn't realize in creating a python project of this nature is just how many libaries it would need as much of the code I used wouldn't have worked if I didn't use libraries

The project was simple on purpose as I wanted to test my coding skills while at the same time giving me something realistic that I can look back on and learn on, I did enjoy working on this project and there was a few other projects I had in mind knowing that the final project was coming up but after realizing the scope of them I thought they would not be appropriate for the scope that CS50 recommends for the final project

I enjoyed creating this project as it taught me a lot about how to operate with python on my own and allowed me to create what I wanted to, the hardest part to me about making this project wasn't the code but rather trying to work around the API I was using with Alpha Vantage and the free tier limits as there were times where I was losing my mind trying to figure out why it wasn't working as I was like "the code should be good as Its not giving me any errors so why is it not working" even with that problems I still did like this project and it allowed me to see what I was good at and what I need to work on overall CS50 was a great course for me to learn coding and how I should learn and not be afraid to look for help as I was in the mindset that a coder shouldn't use outside help to learn things and just push through it, but this class taught me it was okay to look for help just not to let other people code for you, overall CS50 was a great course and I am glad I have taken it, and I would recommand it to anyone who wants to try their hands at coding as while coding is not a thing for everyone CS50 is one of the best ways for people to see if its for them or not
